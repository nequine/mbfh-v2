 Fork of the Megascans Bridge for Houdini shipped by Quixel


The creation of this fork has been motivated by two things :

- My curiosity to try out the new 3delight|NSI with megascans assets, as it seems to be a promising renderer and is not supported by the plugin
- The current stance of Quixel regarding the Megascans Bridge plugins oriented for offline rendering. Indeed, they are on maintenance status only and it is not in their plan to bring any kind of new features or supporting new renderer.  


At the time I started to work on this fork, there were also multiple issues that were plagging the plugin for houdini and was very frustrating ( I believe they fixed most of them in the 4.5, kudos to them). I wanted to share with the community a plugin free of those issues and working as intended.
